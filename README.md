# Advanced Sales Analysis for Retail Networks: Insights with Python and Data Science

## Description

This project aims to conduct an advanced sales data analysis for a retail network. Using Python and Data Science concepts, we seek to gain meaningful insights from a real dataset about a retail network that sells various products in multiple cities in the USA.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary language used for data analysis, data manipulation, and visualization.
- **Pandas**: For DataFrame manipulation and data handling.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: Libraries for creating charts and visualizations, such as bar charts, line charts, pie charts, among others.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used for interactive analysis and visualizations.
- **Data Science Academy**: Reference for Python fundamentals courses for Data Analysis and Data Science.

## Features

1. **Business Question 1**:
   - Which city had the highest sales value for 'Office Supplies' products?

2. **Business Question 2**:
   - What is the total sales per order date?
   - Demonstrated through a bar chart.

3. **Business Question 3**:
   - What is the total sales by state?
   - Demonstrated through a bar chart.

4. **Business Question 4**:
   - Which are the 10 cities with the highest total sales?
   - Demonstrated through a bar chart.

5. **Business Question 5**:
   - Which segment had the highest total sales?
   - Demonstrated through a pie chart.

6. **Business Question 6**:
   - What is the total sales value by segment and year?

7. **Business Question 7**:
   - The companyâ€™s managers are considering granting different discount tiers and would like to run a simulation based on the rule:
   - If `Valor_Venda` is greater than 1000, grant a 15% discount.
   - If `Valor_Venda` is less than 1000, grant a 10% discount.
   - How many sales would receive a 15% discount?

8. **Business Question 8**:
   - Assuming the company decides to grant a 15% discount on the previous item. What would be the average sale value before and after the discount?

9. **Business Question 9**:
   - Average sales by segment, by year, and by month.
   - Demonstrated through a line chart.

10. **Business Question 10**:
   - Total sales by category and subcategory, considering only the top 12 subcategories.
   - Demonstrated through a single chart.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Python 3.x
   - Required libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

2. **Steps to run**:
   1. Clone the repository.
   2. Navigate to the project directory.
   3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to view and interact with the charts.

## Key Visualizations

1. **Chart 1**: Total sales by category and subcategory, considering only the top 12 subcategories.
2. **Chart 2**: Average sales by segment, by year, and by month.
3. **Chart 3**: Total sales by segment and year.
4. **Chart 4**: Segment with the highest total sales.
