Advanced Sales Analysis for Retail Networks: Insights with Python and Data Science
Description
This project aims to conduct an advanced sales data analysis for a retail network. Using Python and Data Science concepts, we seek to gain meaningful insights from a real dataset about a retail network that sells various products in multiple cities in the USA.

Technologies Used
Python: The primary language used for data analysis, data manipulation, and visualization.
Pandas: For DataFrame manipulation and data handling.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: Libraries for creating charts and visualizations, such as bar charts, line charts, pie charts, among others.
Jupyter Notebook: Used for interactive analysis and visualizations.
Data Science Academy: Reference for Python fundamentals courses for Data Analysis and Data Science.
Features
Business Question 1:

Which city had the highest sales value for 'Office Supplies' products?
Business Question 2:

What is the total sales per order date?
Demonstrated through a bar chart.
Business Question 3:

What is the total sales by state?
Demonstrated through a bar chart.
Business Question 4:

Which are the 10 cities with the highest total sales?
Demonstrated through a bar chart.
Business Question 5:

Which segment had the highest total sales?
Demonstrated through a pie chart.
Business Question 6:

What is the total sales value by segment and year?
Business Question 7:

The companyâ€™s managers are considering granting different discount tiers and would like to run a simulation based on the rule:
If Valor_Venda is greater than 1000, grant a 15% discount.
If Valor_Venda is less than 1000, grant a 10% discount.
How many sales would receive a 15% discount?
Business Question 8:

Assuming the company decides to grant a 15% discount on the previous item. What would be the average sale value before and after the discount?
Business Question 9:

Average sales by segment, by year, and by month.
Demonstrated through a line chart.
Business Question 10:

Total sales by category and subcategory, considering only the top 12 subcategories.
Demonstrated through a single chart.
